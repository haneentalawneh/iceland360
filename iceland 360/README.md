1 week 

What did I like about it ? 

I liked the stitching and editing process as it's something totally new to me to work on creating 360 videos. 

Challenges :

Streaming video from the internet in unity video player, youtube doesn't work, I had to use dropbox but the video rendering is a bit slow, so one of the videos is streamed online and the other is local.
