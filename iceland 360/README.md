1 week 

What did I like about it ? 

I liked the stitching and editing process as it's something totally new to me to work on creating 360 videos. 

Challenges :

Streaming video from the internet in unity video player, where a tradeoff had to be done, the video quality had to be lower so the streaming can be faster, but game size is significantly smaller
